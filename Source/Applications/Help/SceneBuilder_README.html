</UL>

<h2> Version 1.3.3</h2>

  <LI> The volume constraint used within Omicron "model" set to be 1% of the VOI volume</LI>

<h2> Version 1.3.1</h2>
<h3>Added Features</h3>
<UL>

  <LI> Added CUBIT facet file reader</LI>
</UL>
<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>
<UL>
  <LI>If a new dataset is loaded over an existing data, the

</UL>
  
<h2> Version 1.3.0</h2>
<h3>Added Features</h3>
<UL>
  <LI> Added "Hover" (2D coordinates) in lower left corner of GUI when in 2D manipulation mode</LI>
  <LI> Added Random placement of objects with Polygon (contour) and/or VOI constraints; these constraints can be
  combined together with "Invert" capability.</LI>
  <LI> Setting of canonical directions no longer does a resetView; the focal point is unchanged, but the camera
  position (based on desired view direction and "current" camera distance) and viewUp are changed. This
  allows the view to stay focused on a region of interest. The user can click "resetView" if zooming out
  was also desired (so extra click in that case).</LI>
  <LI> When switching between 2D and 3D manipulation modes, set parallel scale or camera position (respectively)
  to keep approximately the same view (of course, when switching to 2D, will be looking down a major axis,
  so it is really the apparent "distance" of the camera from the data that is kept ~constant).
  <LI> Changed 2D controls to more closely match 3D controls (in particular, Pan as middle mouse button) </LI>
  <LI> Restructuring of context menus</LI>
  <LI> Moved to "Version 4" CMB files (with increased support for 2D models)</LI>
</UL>
<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>
<UL>
  <LI> Lines and Contours parent nodes were being created (if didn't exist) when doing a CMB file export.</LI>
</UL>

<h2> Version 1.2.1</h2>
<h3>Added Features</h3>
<UL>
  <LI> Can switch between "2D Manipulation" and "3D Manipulation" options for camera</LI>
  <LI> Added TIN stitching option so that can "force" stiching as type I (if the two loops have same # of points);
  tolerance isn't needed for the stitch during Type I stitch. Also, in the older "Auto-detect" mode, the
  tolerance is automatically (internally) increased if it fails at the initial setting</LI>
</UL>
<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>
<UL>
  <LI> Bug: Clarification of "use Triangle" option in TIN stitching; originally was Type I only option which</LI>
  essentially indicated whether or not points could be inserted on the stitch boundary, but could 
  be misinterpreted to mean create triangles instead of quads. Now the option "Allow interior point
  insertion" applies to both Type I and Type II TINs, but for Type I is still ignored if "use Quads"
  is selected. </LI>
  <LI> Bug: If any of the meshes involved in stitch are transformed via actor properties in SceneGen (thus display
  only is transformed), the mesh is transformed before sending it to the mesher (previously display
  transform was ignored during stitching)</LI>
  <LI> Bug: The tolerance factor was computed based on the minimum (x, y, or z) length of the bounds, which is likely
  going to be z, even though z ignored during stitching; now uses min of x of y lengths</LI>
  <LI> Bug: TIN stitching "Line test" used wrong tolerance (MinDistance instead of MinDistance2)</LI>
  <LI> Bug: During line test, only the previous interior point (between start and potential end of line) was being
  tested, not all the points; while testing only previous ok much of the time, not ok in many cases</LI>
  <LI> Bug: MAJOR bug when allowing point insertion; if more than 2 points were inserted on a side, the loop sent
  to triangle was incorrectly ordered (primiarily a type II issue). This may have (probably did) caused
  omicron to fail.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
  <LI> Exposed "Tolerance" for TIN stitching; used for determining equality/line</LI>

</UL>

<h3> Version 0.2.1</h3>
<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>
<UL>
  <LI>Fixed issue with unsetting a node's color. The bug was that if it was a leaf node, then node still thought it still had explicit color.</LI>
</UL>

<h2> Version 0.2.0</h2>
<h3>Added Features</h3>
<UL>
  <LI>Added the ability to un-select the snapping target. This will allow the object to be LOD when interacting with the scene.</LI>
  <LI>All Nodes can have explicit color associated with them. This color is then propagated down to its children nodes unless they have an explicit color associated with them. If an object is selected and the color is changed via the display panel then the associated node will have an explicit color assigned to it.</LI>
  <LI>Explicit Node Color information has been added to the .sg file (note that this was added in such a way that the version number did not have to change.</LI>
  <LI>Reading is OSDL files now sets the color at the higher level nodes (Solids, Occluders, and Surfaces) instead of at the leaf nodes.</LI>
  <LI>The user has the ability to remove the explicit color property from any node except for the root node of the scene.</LI>
  <LI>When importing an object, the user can now randomly place the object as well as indicate how many "copies" should be created (if an object has been identified as the snapping target) .</LI>
  <LI>During Import, the user can now indicate if the object should be initially rotated and scaled.</LI>
  <LI>Similar to the changes to "Import Object", a new feature called "Duplicate Node Randomly" which allows the user to randomly duplicate the object N times. Where N is set by the user.</LI>
  <LI>A progress dialog is now displayed when reading in a .sg file.</LI>
  <LI>"Mapped Scalars" is now off by default.</LI>
  <LI>Added new splash screen.</LI>
