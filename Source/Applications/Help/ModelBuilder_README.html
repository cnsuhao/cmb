</UL>
<h3>Fixed Bugs:</h3>
<UL>
  <LI>If a new dataset is loaded over an existing data, the display panel may show duplicated/multiple</LI>
</UL>

<h2>Version 1.3.0</h2>
<h3>Added Features</h3>
<UL>
  <LI>Added "Hover" (2D coordinates) in lower left corner of GUI when in 2D manipulation mode.</LI>
  <LI>Setting of canonical directions no longer does a resetView; the focal point is unchanged, but the camera
    position (based on desired view direction and "current" camera distance) and viewUp are changed. This
    allows the view to stay focused on a region of interest. The user can click "resetView" if zooming out
    was also desired (so extra click in that case).</LI>
  <LI>When switching between 2D and 3D manipulation modes, set parallel scale or camera position (respectively)
    to keep approximately the same view (of course, when switching to 2D, will be looking down a major axis
    so it is really the apparent "distance" of the camera from the data that is kept ~constant).</LI>
  <LI>Changed 2D controls to more closely match 3D controls (in particular, Pan as middle mouse button).</LI>
  <LI>Added feature to create a nodal group directly from the grow result, which first does splits on model faces
    if necessary, then creates nodal group from the selected model faces.</LI>
  <LI>Modified the default line segment (well) representation in CMB so that it can show the points better when selected.</LI>
  <LI>Moved to "Version 4" CMB files (with increased support for 2D models)</LI>
</UL>

 NOTE: In the future, We should/will load PointsInside info from "model" input file<br />
 if they are not present.</p>

<h2>Version 0.2.2</h2>
* Modified drag-drop behavior on the Trees in CMB so that they behave more consistently.<br />
* Fixed some issues with *Grow* operation related Toolbar button update.<br />

* Fixed some cmb file-reading backward compatibility issues.<br />
* Fixed the model face selection process - it was always missing cell 0.<br />
* Fixed issue with clearing the selection based on growing.</p>

<h2>Version 0.2.0</h2>
<p>1. There is now the ability to export the Boundary Condition information. The file is in XML format with<br />
descriptions included. The data that is stored is:<br />
* node locations<br />
* mesh facets with the number of nodes, the mesh facet's model face, and the node Ids<br />
* model faces with the model face's shell Id and user specified name<br />
* boundary conditions with a user specified name and Id, type (currently only face but point type in the future) and the model face Ids that the BC is applied over<br />
* materials with specified user name and Id<br />
* shells with User specified name and material of the shell<br />
Note that all objects are ordered implicitly starting from zero.</p>

<p>2. Grow</p>

<p>2.1 There is a toolbar with three buttons (Grow, Clear-Grow, Accept-Grow) and a spinbox for changing Angles.<br />
* Grow-button is used to start a grow-selection from a mesh facet based on the angle in the spinbox.<br />
 After click the grow button in the toolbar, the Mouse cursor will become a "Pointing Hand" to indicate that<br />
 we are in "Grow" mode. When we are in this mode, the regular selection toolbar is disabled,<br />
 and the selection from the trees is also disabled. To get back to the regular selection mode, we need to either<br />
 Clear-Grow or Accept-Grow, or uncheck the Grow-button.<br />
* Accept-Grow will create a new BC with the grow-selection, which includes subdividing model faces if necessary, and<br />
 create a new BC with the selected model faces.<br />
* Clear-Grow will clear the current grow selection without generateing new BCS.<br />
2.2 If Ctrl-Key is down, we can select/deselect individual mesh facets, to edit a current grow-selection,<br />
 or to create a brand new selection from scratch by picking or rubber-banding mesh facets.</p>

<p>***!!! Note: For each picking/grow operation, a click on Grow-button is required. !!!***</p>

<p>3. Merge</p>

<p>* Model faces belong to the same shell can be merged together.</p>

<h2>Version 0.1.7</h2>
<p> (A major upgrade from previous versions)</p>
<p>1. Input</p>

<p>1.1 Supported formats: "CMB files (*.cmb);;VTK data files (*.vtk *.vtu);;Solids (*.2dm)"</p>

<p>2. Object Viewing and Properties Modification</p>

<p>2.1 There are two tree widgets in the "Property" tab of the left GUI panel. The top tree is set up by hierarchy<br />
Material->Shell->Model Face (MF), in which the MF is the basic *object* that all CMB operations<br />
will operate on. The tree hierarchy can be reorganized by dragging and dropping with certain contraints.<br />
The bottom tree is for creating/viewing/modifying boundary conditions (BC). Again drag-n-drop can be used here too<br />
to reorganize or create new BCs. You can even drag items from the top tree into the bottom tree to create BCs.<br />
2.2 There is a visibility column in both trees, which can be used to control visibility of different objects.<br />
2.3 Material and Shell names can be modified by editing directly in the top tree, and BC names can be modified<br />
directly by editing text in the bottom tree.<br />
2.4 MFs can be split by changing the feature angles of selected MFs.<br />
2.5 A one-step "Reset State" can reverse the modifications of Material/Shell/BC names, BCs and MFs to<br />
the last saved state created by "Save State"</p>

<p>3. Display</p>

<p>3.1 There are many display related properties that can be modified from the "Display" tab of the left GUI panel,<br />
such as changing the representation style, doing transformation, modifying lighting, edge style and annotation etc.<br />
If there is no MF selected in the scene, the changes of display properties will be applied to all<br />
MFs; if there are selected MFs, the changes will be applied only to those selected faces.<br />
3.2 There are also toolbar buttons to modify camera view direction, colorby classification (Matererial,<br />
Shell, MF, BC). The "Set color button" in the toolbar can change the solid color for those selected MFs.<br />
3.3 Known issue. We need to work out how to preserve/modify/display colors that are saved in the CMB file.</p>

<p>4. Selection</p>

<p>4.1 A rubber band style selection (mousedown-n-drag or just click) is offered with a toolbar button. All the<br />
visible MFs within the rubber band boundary will be selected. If the Shift-Key is down while doing the<br />
rubber-band-selection, the previous selections will NOT be cleared, and the new selections are appended to<br />
current selections, otherwise, the previous selection will be cleared, and the new selections will become the<br />
current selection. Note, this selection mechanism is based on surface selection, so if the opacity of an MF is<br />
less than 1, it will NOT be selected with Rubber-band-selection(it can still be selected from the trees).<br />
This *feature* can be used to skip certain MF (such as the ground) while doing rubber-band-selection.<br />
4.2 A "Select mode" toolbar dropdown controls what will be selected after rubber-band-selection. If Material or<br />
Shell is the *selection mode*, the whole material or shell who contains the selected MFs will be selected.<br />
4.3 The selection is also linked with the two tree widgets on the "Properties" tab in the left GUI panel.<br />
4.4 The selection representation style can be changed from a toolbar drop down list.<br />
4.5 "Clear Selection" button on the bottom of the "Properties" tab of the left GUI panel can be used to<br />
clear selections.<br />
4.6. Known issue: There is a *refresh* flicking on the display tab GUI when selections are changed.</p>

<p>5. Output</p>

<p>5.1 CMB can save out CMB Files(*.cmb).<br />
5.2 An Omicron input file (.dat), for "mesh", can be generated. It requires specification of the "model" input.</p>

<p>6. Spawn Mesher<br />
6.1 "Spawn Surface Mesher" option and "Spawn Volume Mesher" option<br />
 - user can select alternate executable (e.g. - if not built with the app)<br />
 - abort button to kill the process<br />
 - "Process Output" button to display the output from the Process<br />
 - The progress bar for monitoring spawned processes will display messages extracted from the<br />
 process output (indicated by "Progress: " at the start of the line of output)<br />
 - NOTE: if click in "Process Output" window, new text added at the cursor location, even though the<br />
 code seems to be coorect to place it at the end<br />
 - Upon successful completion, user asked if they want to load the output<br />
6.2 The default surface and volume meshers are remembered during a session. In other words, if you change<br />
 which surface mesher to use (or specify which one to use becuase there is no default), the next time you<br />
 start up the surface mesher DURING THAT SESION, the previously indicated mesher will be used.</p>

<p>7. Testing<br />
7.1 There are utilities to record and replay a test under the "Tools" menu.</p>

<h2>Version 0.1.6</h2>

<p>- The default surface and volume meshers are remembered during a session. In other words, if you change<br />
 which surface mesher to use (or specify which one to use becuase there is no default), the next time you<br />
 start up the surface mesher DURING THAT SESION, the previously indicated mesher will be used.<br />
- The progress bar for monitoring spawned processes has been replaced by messages extracted from the<br />
 process output (indicated by "Progress: " at the start of the line of output)</p>

<h2>Version 0.1.5</h2>

<p>- Issue with "Selection" noted in 0-1-4 has been fixed. Can also now "clear" selection using button in<br />
 Save State/Restore State area<br />
- Can now load from "Recent Files"<br />
- "Spawn Surface Mesher" option and "Spawn Volume Mesher" option<br />
 - user can select alternate executable (e.g. - if not built with the app)<br />
 - progress bar indicates process is running (but not actually linked to progress)<br />
 - abort button to kill the process<br />
 - "Process Output" button to display the output from the Process<br />
 - NOTE: if click in "Process Output" window, new text added at the cursor location, even though the<br />
 code seems to be coorect to place it at the end<br />
 - Upon successful completion, user asked if they want to load the output<br />
- A lot of source re-organization and cleaning-up under the hood for future development.<br />
 - Help now displays README.txt file</p>

<h2>Version 0.1.4</h2>

<p>1. Input</p>

<p>1.1 Supported formats: "ParaView files (*.vtk *.vtu *.vtm);;Solids (*.2dm)"<br />
1.2 After loading the geometry file, a MF (boundary condition) file, which is<br />
associated with the geometry file, can also be loaded.<br />
1.3 Known issue: if the MFs file does not match the geoemtry file that was loaded<br />
(different number of "faces"/primitives) or does not have the expected information, an<br />
"Output Messages" dialog will indicate an error, but the CMB will not crash.<br />
1.4 Known issue: Reading .sol file is disabled because the new source class, vtkHydroModelSource,<br />
does not handle multi-block dataset yet.</p>

<p><br />
2. Display</p>

<p>2.1 There are many display related properties that can be modified from the "Display" tab of the left GUI panel,<br />
such as selecting different cell arrays of the cell data to color,<br />
changing the representation style, doing transformation, modifying lighting, edge style and annotation etc.<br />
2.2 There are also toolbar buttons to modify camera view direction, colorby different cell arrays and<br />
change view representation.</p>

<p><br />
3. Selection</p>

<p>3.1 A rubber band style selection (mousedown-n-drag or just click) is offered with a toolbar button.<br />
3.2 The selection can also be changed from the "Properties" tab in the left GUI panel by selecting rows<br />
in the MFs table or Material/Region table.<br />
3.3 Known Issues: There are some issues currently with refreshing the selections in the Material/Region table<br />
and the MFs table of the left GUI panel when a selection is cleared on the display.</p>

<p><br />
4. Properties Modification</p>

<p>4.1 Material IDs can be modified by selecting the regions in the Material table of the Properties tab.<br />
4.2 MFs can be regenerated(splitted) by changing the feature angles of selected MFs.<br />
Different faces from the same region can also be merged into one MF.<br />
4.3 A one-step "Reset State" can reverse the modifications of Material IDs and MFs to<br />
the last saved state created by "Save State"</p>

<p><br />
5. Output</p>

<p>5.1 CMB can save out a .vtk and .2dm file. If the vtk format is selected, a MFs file will also<br />
be saved (see 5.2). If "Save Data" as output.vtk, MFs will be save to outputBC.vtk.<br />
5.2 A new MFs (Boundary Conditions) file can also be saved out from CMB (will indicate the<br />
geometry file that was read in as the geometry for the faces)<br />
5.3 An Omicron input file (.dat), for "mesh", can be generated. It requires specification of the "model" input.</p>
