.. index:: Display Tab

The Display Tab
===============

.. findfigure:: DisplayTab.*
	:align: right
	:scale: 75%

The Display Tab contains various options related to displaying the model.

"Representation" changes the way the model is displayed in the viewport

	3D Glyphs: show the 3D glyphs at the underlying points

	Outline: display the bounding box of the model

	Point Gaussian: show the underlying points as solid spheres

	Points: show the underlying points as solid dots

	Surface: hide the underlying polygons, faces, etc.

	Surface With Edges: display the surface and the underlying edges

	Wireframe: display the wireframe of the underlying structures

When viewing the mesh of an object, it may be worth switching the representation
to “Wireframe” or “Surface with edges”

Coloring
--------
The model can be colored by certain variables, which could not be done with
"Color By" menu. For example, we can color the ChesapeakeBayContour introduced
in :ref:`Discrete Session <discrete-session>` with its Z coordinate.

.. findfigure:: ColorByZ.*
	:align: center
	:scale: 75%

Styling
-------
Opacity: control the transparency of the model

Lighting
--------
Specular: control the specularity of the model

Transforming
------------
Translation: translate the model in 3D

Scale: scale the model

Orientation: define the orientation of the model

Origin: define the center of the model

Miscellaneous
-------------
Data Axes Grid: display axes grid that helps to visualize the data

Maximum Number of Labels: control the number of labels
