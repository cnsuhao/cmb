ModelBuilder v4 User Manual

This project is built using [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/). Have it installed and run `make html` or `make latexpdf` or any other target (look at Makefile for targets). A make.bat exists for Windows users.

Eventually we will setup a hook between this repo and readthedocs.org so a hosted HTML version exists.
