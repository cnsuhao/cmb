The Info Tab
============

This tab does not have configurable options; it only displays the statistical
information of the model and the mesh.

There are two sub-tabs under it: "Selection" and "Visualization".
"Selection" shows the information of the selected mesh, including the number of
volumes, faces, edges, vertices and points.

"Visualization" shows the rendering information of the model. â€œData Hierarchy"
is a hierarchical list of all the entities in the scene. Each can be individually
selected to view more information. "Information" shows the overall information
about the VTK dataset. The related data, for example coordinates can be viewed
in "Data Arrays" and "Bounds". Time values will be displayed if it exists.
