The Info Tab
============

This tab contains no configurable options; There are purely information items on this tab.

There are two columns of information under it: "Selection" and "Visualization". "Selection" shows the mesh information of the model, therefore it will be valid only when a mesh is selected

.. findfigure:: InfoSelection.*

"Visualization" shows the rendering information. â€œData Hierarchy" is a hierarchical list of all the elements in the scene. Each can be individually selected to view more information. "Information" shows the overall information about the VTK dataset. The related data, for example coordinates can be viewed in "Data Arrays" and "Bounds". Time values will be displayed if it exists
